# About Project
This small project is inspired by Telegram mobile feature. When you are reading an article in Telegram on mobile phone, you are able to change styles, I'have noticed something similar in new IOS 16, where you can customize mobile screen. I thing it's good feature for desktop users too. This app is mockup of this feature on desktop. Have a good day.
